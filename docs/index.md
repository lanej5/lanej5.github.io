## Math Research

My research in symplectic geometry focuses on connections between classical and quantum mechanics via a procedure called "geometric quantization." 
I study classical commutative integrable systems that arise from non-commuting Hamiltonian Lie group actions.
Remarkably, geometric quantization of these integrable systems recovers canonical bases of the associated Lie group representation. In this work I combine tools from differential, complex, and algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, Lie theory, analysis, and representation theory.
