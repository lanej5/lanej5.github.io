## About Me

I'm a mathematician and applied scientist. 
After my PhD I spent 5 years as a postdoctoral researcher in academia. Since 2022 I've been working at Amazon.


## Machine Learning and Data Science

At Amazon I've worked problems ranging from time series modelling, clustering, causal inference, recommender systems, graph search, panel data, survey design, and predictive ad targeting. 

In my first year I independently delivered a scalable, end-to-end ML system for ad targeting through all phases of the product lifecycle (development, proof of concept testing, product launch, and product iteration).   As part of this system I built a feature store pipeline thats been adopted by other predictive workflows in my team.   The product is on track to exceed 2023 revenue goals by 2x and adoption goals by 5x.

## Math Research

My research in symplectic geometry focuses on connections between classical and quantum mechanics via a procedure called "geometric quantization."  I study classical commutative integrable systems that arise from non-commuting Hamiltonian Lie group actions on symplectic manifolds.
Remarkably, quantization of these integrable systems recovers canonical bases of the associated Lie group representation.  In this work I combine tools from geometry, topology, Lie theory, analysis, and representation theory.
