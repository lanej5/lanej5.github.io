## Symplectic Geometry Research

My research in symplectic geometry focuses on connections between classical and quantum mechanics via a procedure called "geometric quantization." 
I study classical commutative integrable systems that arise from non-commuting Hamiltonian Lie group actions.
Remarkably, geometric quantization of these integrable systems recovers canonical bases of the associated Lie group representation.

The first example of this phenomenon was observed by Guillemin and Sternberg in the early 1980s. 
They showed that the Gelfand-Zeitlin canonical basis of a unitary representation can be obtained by geometric quantization of a certain integrable system on unitary coadjoint orbits. 
My research has generalized this result to arbitrary compact Lie groups and drawn connections with other domains, such as tropicalization of Lie brackets and Ginzburg-Weistein isomorphisms.
