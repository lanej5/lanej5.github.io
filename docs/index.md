## About Me

I'm a mathematician and applied scientist. 
- At Amazon I combine machine learning and econometrics to deliver scalable ad measurement and targeting solutions.
- I have 5 years experience as a math researcher, solving problems in differential geometry and mathematical physics and publishing in top journals.


## Machine Learning and Data Science

At Amazon I'm working on ad measurement solutions combining 1P and 3P datasets, panel data, machine learning and econometrics.

In my first year I independently delivered a scalable, end-to-end ML system for ad targeting through all phases of the product life-cycle (development, testing, product launch, and product iteration). In 2023 the product is on track to 2x its revenue goals and 5x its adoption goals.

## Mathematics

My research in symplectic geometry focuses on connections between classical and quantum mechanics via geometric quantization.  I study classical commutative integrable systems that arise from non-commuting Hamiltonian Lie group actions. In this work I combine tools from geometry, topology, Lie theory, analysis, and representation theory.  My papers have appeared in top journals such as the Journal of Symplectic Geometry and Advances in Mathematics.

I've taught topics such as vector calculus, linear algebra, graph theory and combinatorics, and scientific computing labs.
